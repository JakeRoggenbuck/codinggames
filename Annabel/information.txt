Annabel's concept was inspired by an image of a long desert road. Despire being a game, I'm envisioning more "interactive" storytelling. So, simple button presses and lots of string literals. I don't know if it will be any good but I guess we'll see. Testers shouldn't be as needed but inevitably something will come up.
