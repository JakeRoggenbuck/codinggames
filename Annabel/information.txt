Annabel's concept was inspired by an image of a long desert road. Despite being a game, I'm envisioning more "interactive" storytelling. So, simple button presses and lots of string literals. I don't know if it will be any good but I guess we'll see. Testers shouldn't be as needed but inevitably something will come up. Since it will be more story driven it would be advantageous to have a method to store place in game. However, I don't really know how to do that so there will be limited save points like in older video games. They will be called road signs. They will have a random-ish string so you can't just increment numerically. When reopening the program, you will be prompted for a road sign and you will resume from that sign.
